This is a test post. I am using Jekyll to build a simple web site to keep track of important links and things that I want to remember. Over the years I have accumulated a number of scripts that will be added here as I deduplicate, consolidate and clean up my files (Data Management??). Hopefully, this will help others working on similar things find this information and maybe save time.

Jekyll has support for adding code snippets, and is easy to maintain using gitHub.

Testing Java and Bash code formatting, as my go-to programming language is `Java` and `bash`.

{% highlight Java %}
  /**
  * HelloWorld.java
  * Test Code to print "Hello World!" to the terminal
  */
  public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
          // Print "Hello, World" to the terminal.
          System.out.println("Hello, World");
      }
  }
{% endhighlight %}

And shell


{% highlight shell %}
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World!"
{% endhighlight %}
